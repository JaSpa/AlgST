sendInt1 : ∀(s:SL). !Int.s -> s
sendInt1 [s] c = send [Int, s] 1 c

-- Intresting: because 'send' has to work both for linear and unrestricted
-- types an eta-reduced version is not possible.
--
-- Since 'send' is built-in we *could* require that it is always used with a
-- type application and specify a poor man's version of kind polymorphism.
--
-- sendInt2 : ∀(s:SL). !Int.s -> s
-- sendInt2 = send [Int] 2
