{- Note [Async Consumer / Producer]

We run the consumer in a new thread, asynchronous to the producer. We want to
ensure that

(1) We wait for the consumer to terminate before returning from
    `withAsyncOutput`.

    This is also required by the type signature of `withAsyncOutput`. One part
    of the return value has to come from the completed consumer.

    It is achieved by first sending the termination signal using
    `terminateActionBuffer` and then blocking on `wait` inside of `withAsync`.

(2) An exception in the producer should terminate the consumer gracefully.

    We achieve this in the same manner as (1). We do this by wrapping the
    producer in `finally`.

(3) An exception in the consumer should propagate the exception to the
    producer.

    This is important so that a crashed consumer does not lead to a producer
    blocked on a full `OutputHandle`.

    This is the part that is tricky: if we only do a `wait` once the producer
    has finished we never get to the point to forward the exception in a way to
    interrupt the producer as it might be blocked on a full `OutputHandle`.

    We could `link` the consumer to the producer thread. This would forward any
    exceptions as soon as they originate in the consumer. How to wait for the
    consumer to terminate in the successfull case though? If we use `wait` the
    ordering between the asynchronous forwarding from `link` and the
    synchronous throw from `wait` is not guaranteed. I think it might even
    happen that the synchronous version is partially handled before suddenly
    the asynchronous exception interrupts.

    We use a custom version of `link` which is run using `withAsync` so that
    the linking is scoped. Exceptions forwarded through `withScopedLink` are
    wrapped inside `OutputException`.

--
-- 1. Messages will only stick to the bottom of the screen for other

--
-- 2. Sticky messages should be kept relatively short: if the terminal's width
-- broke a sticky message into multiple lines it would become impossible to
-- clear more than the last line resulting in the partial sticky message
-- remaining on screen.
--
-- 3. Support for sticky messages requires for the output device to support
-- ANSI escape sequences. If support for these is not detected sticky messages
-- will appear as if output as regular messages via 'outputStrLn'.
